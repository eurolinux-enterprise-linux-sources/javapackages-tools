NAME
----
pom_xpath_inject - inject XML code into POM file

SYNOPSIS
--------
*%pom_xpath_inject* XPath [XML-code] [POM-location]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This macro patches specified POM file appending some code as childreen
of all XML nodes described by the XPath expression.

XPath is an expression describing a set of XML nodes in the POM file
to which child code is to be appended.  It must be a properly formated
XPath 1.0 expression, as described in http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath/.

POM location can be either a full path to the POM file, or a path to
the directory containing *pom.xml*.  If POM location is not given then
*pom.xml* from current working directory is used.

EXAMPLES
--------
*%pom_xpath_inject pom:project "<packaging>war</packaging>"* - this
call sets packaging of POM in current working directory to *war*.

BUGS
----
POM files use a specific namespace -
http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0.  Currently this namespace needs to
be explicitly specified in all XPath POM macros by prefixing all node
names with *pom:*.
